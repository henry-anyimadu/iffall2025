    <li>I've always loved creating aesthetically pleasing projects (read: cool looking stuff), and I wanted to learn how to better do that tying in a web format.</li>
    <li>Yes, I've created a few projects using HTML/CSS/JS for various clubs, as well as a personal website that I'm looking to update.</li>
    <li>I'm hoping to learn more about responsive design and how to make my projects more user-friendly and overall clean-looking.</li>
    <li>When designing for the screen, there's a defined way that users can interact with a design, and users usually interact with an end 
        goal in mind. This, combined with a change in constraints compared to paper, are the main differences between designing for the 
        screen and designing for paper.
    </li>
    <li>I think https://claude.ai/new exemplifies good design, as it easy to understand the primary function of the website, and new and experienced users
        can experience the end result they want in little time.
    </li>
    <li>I believe https://www.economist.com/ shows effective communication because of its text hierarchy. Your eye is drawn to the major news stories, and
        users can also visit more niche topics, all without feeling cluttered.
    </li>
    <li>I think https://www.youtube.com/ works well, as it effortlessly allows its users to upload and view hundreds of terabytes worth of content with very low latency.</li>
