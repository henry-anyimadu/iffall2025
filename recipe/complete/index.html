                    <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>Blend the red bell peppers, tomatoes, and scotch bonnet peppers until smooth. In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil and add the sliced onions. Fry until translucent, then add the blended pepper mix and tomato paste. Cook for about 20-25 minutes until the sauce is reduced and the oil starts to separate.</p>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>While the sauce is cooking, wash the rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Add the chicken or beef stock to the reduced sauce, followed by the curry powder, dried thyme, bay leaves, salt, and stock cube. Stir well and bring to a boil.</p>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>Add the washed rice to the boiling sauce. Stir to combine, ensuring the rice is fully submerged. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through. For a smoky flavor, you can let the rice burn slightly at the bottom (the "party rice" effect).</p>
