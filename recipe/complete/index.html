                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>Sear the pre-cooked protein in oil over medium heat until the edges brown and caramelize; set aside to keep the pieces tender.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>Sweat sliced onions in the same pot until translucent, then stir in garlic, blended tomatoes, tomato paste, peppers, and any stock. Season assertively with both peppers, salt, and stock cube if using.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>Simmer the tomato base for about 10 minutes until it thickens and the raw tomato smell cooks off, scraping the fond from the pot for extra depth.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 4</h3>
                    <p>Add the rinsed rice, mixing to coat every grain, then return the seared protein (or vegetables) to the pot. Cover and cook on low heat for roughly 20 minutes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 5</h3>
                    <p>Stir in an extra cup of water if the rice needs moisture, add vegetables if using, and continue cooking gently until the grains are fluffy and the sauce is fully absorbed.</p>
